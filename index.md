# {{site.title}} (I use arch btw)

i am a 15 year old from Vidisha. i really dont't have a fav language but i love to try almost everything from 3D modelling to functional programming, linux and tons of other cool stuff.

i am a [Hackclubber](https://hackclub.com/) and the co-leader at [hackclub vidisha](https://vidisha.hackclub.com).

i started my journey in tech when i was 12 and learnt photo editing in lightroom. later, pirating pc games made me even more enthusiastic. i switched to linux which got me into coding with python from CS50P. in november 2024, i attended [counterspell]by hackclub and started my journey at hackclub. i learnt many things like react, tailwind, C, designing in figma.
