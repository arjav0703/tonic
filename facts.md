## Fun facts
About Me: Arch Linux Edition
💻 "I use Arch, btw" isn’t just a flex-it’s my way of saying, “Yes, I enjoy pain, but only the kind that comes with compiling kernels at 2 AM.”

🔧 Fun Facts:

    I don’t need a GUI. My terminal is my spirit animal, and neofetch is my love language.

    WiFi drivers? Pfft. I manually configured my router with a series of angry iw commands and sheer spite.

    “Just install Ubuntu” is the funniest joke I’ve ever heard. (I laughed so hard I accidentally rm -rf’d my coffee mug.)

    My archinstall script is older than some Linux distros. It’s basically my autobiography.

    “It’s not a bug-it’s a feature” is how I explain my life choices to my cat. (She judges me silently.)

🌐 When I’m not:

    Writing 50-line aliases to save 3 keystrokes.

    Arguing with pacman about why it insists on upgrading that one package right before my Zoom meeting.

    Pretending I understand Wayland. (X11 forever! …until it’s not.)

🚀 Life motto: “If it breaks, I’ll fix it. If it’s fixed, I’ll break it again. Repeat until the heat death of the universe.”

(Disclaimer: No actual coffee mugs were harmed in the making of this bio. Probably.)
