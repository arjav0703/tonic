## Fun Facts
💻 "I use Arch, btw" isn’t just a flex—it’s my way of saying, “Yes, I enjoy pain, but only the kind that comes with compiling kernels at 2 AM.”

🔧 **Fun Facts**:

- I don’t need a GUI. My terminal is my spirit animal, and neofetch is my love language.
- WiFi drivers? Pfft. I manually configured my router with a series of angry `iw` commands and sheer spite.
- “Just install Ubuntu” is the funniest joke I’ve ever heard. (I laughed so hard I accidentally `rm -rf`’d my coffee mug.)
- My `archinstall` script is older than some Linux distros. It’s basically my autobiography.
- “It’s not a bug—it’s a feature” is how I explain my life choices to my cat. (She judges me silently.)

🚀 **Life motto**: “If it breaks, I’ll fix it. If it’s fixed, I’ll break it again. Repeat until the heat death of the universe.”

*(Disclaimer: No actual coffee mugs were harmed in the making of this bio. Probably.)*
